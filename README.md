# Delhi Air Quality Index Analysis Dashboard (2020–2024)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes **Delhi’s Air Quality Index (AQI)** data over the past **four years**, focusing on pollution patterns, seasonal variations, and factors affecting AQI levels. The analysis includes data preprocessing, statistical summaries, visualization dashboards, and predictive modeling.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand long-term pollution behavior in Delhi  
- Detect seasonal & holiday-related spikes in AQI  
- Evaluate the contribution of PM10 levels to overall AQI  
- Build a dashboard summarizing actionable insights for environmental decision-making  

---

## 📂 Dataset
- **Source:** Delhi Air Quality Monitoring Stations data (2020–2024)
- **Total observations:** ~4 years of daily pollution metrics
- **Major parameters analyzed:** `AQI`, `PM2.5`, `PM10`, `NO₂`, `SO₂`, `CO₂`, `Ozone`
- **Additional computed fields:** weekday, holiday flag, quarter, seasonal grouping

---

## 🔍 Key Findings

| Insight | Observation |
|--------|------------|
| **Average AQI** | Significantly higher in winter months (Nov–Jan) |
| **PM10 vs AQI Relationship** | Strong **positive correlation**, confirmed through regression |
| **Holiday Impact** | Higher average AQI on holidays, especially during **Diwali & wedding season** (Nov–Dec) |
| **High Pollution Days** | **680 days** exceeded national AQI safety limits in the last 4 years |
| **Quarterly Comparison** | **4th quarter** recorded the highest average AQI every year |

---

## 📊 Visualizations Included
- Monthly AQI trend chart
- Distribution plots for PM2.5 & PM10
- Heatmap of pollutant gas levels across months
- Weekday-average AQI bar chart
- Holiday vs Non-holiday comparison graph
- Regression graph: **PM10 contribution to AQI**
- Quarter-wise AQI boxplot

---

## 📈 Insights & Conclusion
Delhi continues to experience **severe air pollution**, particularly during winter. Festival activities, wedding fireworks, and seasonal weather patterns significantly elevate particulate matter levels.  

This analysis highlights the need for:
- Stronger seasonal pollution control measures
- Firecracker usage regulations & community awareness
- Policy decisions based on data-backed environmental trends

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Forecasting AQI using **ARIMA / LSTM** models
- Real-time AQI monitoring API integration
- Zone-wise locality comparison dashboard
